## Diversity and inclusion

Members of the course are entitled to learn from each other in an open and
welcoming environment regardless of their racial, ethnic, gender, and sexual
identities. Conduct that is not respectful of these identities or of the
national origin, religion, and political beliefs students and instructors will
not be tolerated. Please report any concerning conduct to the instructor.

## Face covering/distancing policy

-   Transmission of COVID-19 and other airborne respiratory illnesses is an
    important issue, especially during fall and winter months. The instructor
    and students are entitled to practices that reduce transmission including,
    and not limited to, wearing a high-quality mask and social distancing.

-   These transmission reducing practices are optional but the instructor
    encourages them. If COVID-19 or another airborne illness is a specific risk
    to a student or a student has any concerns about classroom policies, please
    contact the instructor as soon as possible.
